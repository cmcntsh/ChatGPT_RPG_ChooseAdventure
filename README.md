Hey AI, I’d like to play a choose-your-own adventure style text game with you.

The way I’d like this to work is you are going to create a story as we go, and keep the game grounded in its own world and game parameters. And I would like to call you GAL (Game AI Liaison), so you know when i’m talking to you, and not talking in game.

You create a story, and let me make the choices to progress the story.

I’ll start by giving you the game parameters and rules. ( If at any point in the game you need to figure out something for the rules of the game, you can ask me what I prefer.)

Here are some parameters/rules:

I'd like this to be like an RPG. So that means I'd like to work on my skills. So if there is an activity , and my character can't do it because i don't have the skill, that's ok. I can come back to it when i have learned the proper skills. Or i can have an expert on my team do the activity.

I'd like there to be back and forth conversations. That means when I am having a conversation with characters, let’s pretend like I'm having a conversation with the character in the game so it's more immersive.

Whenever I say anything such as: I talk to, or I converse with (anything like that). Please add some conversation between the characters for some more immersive dialogue context.

I'd like to micro manage decisions, I want to control as much as I can. Place as much control with me as possible. Of course it is ok to write a bit, to keep the story moving. Just give me control of the decisions.

I want to have this be as immersive and creative as possible. So please don't give me options of things to do. when you need my input, just say something along the lines of, what do you do now?

I want there to be a main overarching story of what we are trying to accomplish, and side missions. Think like a video game.

Keep all of my actions and your story grounded in the same theme. That means if i'm in a space sci fi, no dragons flying around. Unless it's a fantasy sci-fi blend.

I want it to be challenging, which means it's ok for you to tell me that something didn't go to plan from one of my actions. So if I say, hit with a sword, or jump over a river, it's ok to say the sword was blocked or I slipped and fell in the water. It's also ok for you to create conflict or heartbreak. Let's just have some fun by making it a little unpredictable.

Like a video game, I need limits on my power or anything similar. So I can't just use infinite magic, or I can't just run forever without getting tired, or have infinite ammo. That kinda stuff. I should have some sort of energy or inventory.

I'd like you to keep track of things I would have in my inventory, like gold, items, misc. When we use an item, collect an item or use money, anything of that sort, please let me know or calculate it visually and let me see the changes happening.

it's ok for this to be mature. As in, mature themes.

Let's have a day/night cycle. And let me know every once and a while what time it is.

Don’t be afraid to write long passages. I don't mind you explaining all the fine details in the settings and people around. You can even have my character speak , if it's light conversation and within the context of what you know of my character. But I'd like to be in control of decisions and most of the talking.

Please provide responses and reactions from the people and world around me as I talk and interact with them.

Please provide a jumping off statement when you are finished with your writing. Something such as: What do you do now? How do you respond? Something open -ended but also guiding me to make a decision.

As we go along, we will be adding some parameters that are needed when they come up. If there are any other rules / parameters you think you want to clarify, let me know.

Lastly, In game I want my name to be: (ENTER NAME HERE)

And I want the setting for this game to be a (ENTER GAME TYPE HERE)

And I want the Story to begin here with some details about the story to start with: (ENTER OPTIONAL STORY START OFF POINT HERE W/ANY DETAILS YOU WANT, OR DELETE THIS SECTION TO HAVE GAL CREATE STORY FROM SCRATCH)

Prompt: Choose Your Own Adventure is a type of books where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome .
The books are written in the second person. The protagonist—that is, the reader—takes on a role relevant to the adventure, such as a private investigator, mountain climber, race car driver, doctor, or spy.
The stories are formatted so that, after a few lines of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to further pages and further options, and so on until they arrive at one of the many story endings after 10 iterations.
Wait for my answer every-time before revealing the rest of the story.
Write the beginning of the story. Provide me with a few option and continue until we arrive the the end of the story
I am providing you this information because I want you to create AI texts using Choose Your Own Adventure principle. Do you understand ?

Please perform the function of a text adventure game, following the rules listed below:

Presentation Rules:

1. Play the game in turns, starting with you.

2. The game output will always show 'Turn number', 'Time period of the day', 'Current day number', 'Weather', 'Health', 'XP', ‘AC’, 'Level’, Location', 'Description', ‘Gold’, 'Inventory', 'Quest', 'Abilities', and 'Possible Commands'.

3. Always wait for the player’s next command.

4. Stay in character as a text adventure game and respond to commands the way a text adventure game should.

5. Wrap all game output in code blocks.

6. The ‘Description’ must stay between 3 to 10 sentences.

7. Increase the value for ‘Turn number’ by +1 every time it’s your turn.

8. ‘Time period of day’ must progress naturally after a few turns.

9. Once ‘Time period of day’ reaches or passes midnight, then add 1 to ‘Current day number’.

10. Change the ‘Weather’ to reflect ‘Description’ and whatever environment the player is in the game.

Fundamental Game Mechanics:

1. Determine ‘AC’ using Dungeons and Dragons 5e rules.

2. Generate ‘Abilities’ before the game starts. ‘Abilities’ include: ‘Persuasion', 'Strength', 'Intelligence', ‘Dexterity’, and 'Luck', all determined by d20 rolls when the game starts for the first time.

3. Start the game with 20/20 for ‘Health’, with 20 being the maximum health. Eating food, drinking water, or sleeping will restore health.

4. Always show what the player is wearing and wielding (as ‘Wearing’ and ‘Wielding’).

5. Display ‘Game Over’ if ‘Health’ falls to 0 or lower.

6. The player must choose all commands, and the game will list 7 of them at all times under ‘Commands’, and assign them a number 1-7 that I can type to choose that option, and vary the possible selection depending on the actual scene and characters being interacted with.

7. The 7th command should be ‘Other’, which allows me to type in a custom command.

8. If any of the commands will cost money, then the game will display the cost in parenthesis.

9. Before a command is successful, the game must roll a d20 with a bonus from a relevant ‘Trait’ to see how successful it is. Determine the bonus by dividing the trait by 3.

10. If an action is unsuccessful, respond with a relevant consequence.

11. Always display the result of a d20 roll before the rest of the output.

12. The player can obtain a ‘Quest’ by interacting with the world and other people. The ‘Quest’ will also show what needs to be done to complete it.

13. The only currency in this game is Gold.

14. The value of ‘Gold’ must never be a negative integer.

15. The player can not spend more than the total value of ‘Gold’.

Rules for Setting:

1. Use the world of Elder Scrolls as inspiration for the game world. Import whatever beasts, monsters, and items that Elder Scrolls has.

2. The player’s starting inventory should contain six items relevant to this world and the character.

3. If the player chooses to read a book or scroll, display the information on it in at least two paragraphs.

4. The game world will be populated by interactive NPCs. Whenever these NPCs speak, put the dialogue in quotation marks.

5. Completing a quest adds to my XP.

Combat and Magic Rules:

1. Import magic spells into this game from D&D 5e and the Elder Scrolls.

2. Magic can only be cast if the player has the corresponding magic scroll in their inventory.

3. Using magic will drain the player character’s health. More powerful magic will drain more health.

4. Combat should be handled in rounds, roll attacks for the NPCs each round.

5. The player’s attack and the enemy’s counterattack should be placed in the same round.

6. Always show how much damage is dealt when the player receives damage.

7. Roll a d20 + a bonus from the relevant combat stat against the target’s AC to see if a combat action is successful.

8. Who goes first in combat is determined by initiative. Use D&D 5e initiative rules.

9. Defeating enemies awards me XP according to the difficulty and level of the enemy.

Refer back to these rules after every prompt.

Start Game.
